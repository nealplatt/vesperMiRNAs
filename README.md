This work build on a previous [paper](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/6/1536) that described the relationship between DNA transposon expansion in *Eptesicus fuscus* and novel miRNA-like sequences that intersect with these putative miRNAs.  Here we expand on the work by further identifying miRNAs in other vespertilionid species and other mammalian species while testing the putative miRNA relationship with transposable elements in general.  Some of the programs used to complete this work include:
* miRDeep2
* bowtie
* trimmomatic
* bedtools
* ...

These programs are called in various bash shell scripts and data is manipulated using common unix commands.  Manual data manipulation is recorded in the appropriate subscipts.
