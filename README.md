This work build on a previous paper that described the relationship between DNA transposon expansion in Eptesicus fuscus and novel miRNA-like sequences that were derived from these miRNAs.  Here we expand on the work by further identifying miRNAs in other vespertilionid species and testing their relationship with transposable elements in general.  Some of the programs used to complete this work include:
* miRDeep2
* bowtie
* trimmomatic
* bedtools
* ...

These programs are called in various bash shell scripts and data is manipulated using common unix commands.  Manual data manipulation is recorded in the appropriate subscipts.
